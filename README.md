# Currency converter App 

### Project Overview

#### This project is my attempt at a tech test that was presented to me. It involves building a currency converter. The front-end of the responsive application is built using React, CSS, React Hooks (unused before starting this project), Axios, and a third party API. The backend of the project is built using Firebase and firestore, technologies unencountered before starting this project. Finally the hosting of the application is carried out using Netlify.

### User features 

#### It involves a two way dynamic input boxes for original currency and currency to exchange to, which can be chosen through the dropdown menus either side of the boxes. The user is able to choose their two currencies and log their rates for view at a later date. Additionally, users can choose to sort their logs from their newest log to their oldest, as well as hide and show their list of logs for an increased user experience (UI). 

### Getting Started

#### The application can be viewed via the following link: https://jn-currency-converter.netlify.app/ 
#### Feel free to clone the application using the command git clone on the following link: https://github.com/josephnewton861/Currency_convertor_tech_test.git , however Do NOT fork the repository! To start after cloning run the command npm start in the terminal to open the application in your chosen web browser.

### Further features I would like to include in the future

#### - Add a delete button for users to delete their logs after they are finished with them.
#### - Add a prompt and conditional logic to delete button to ensure they do not delete their logs by accident.
